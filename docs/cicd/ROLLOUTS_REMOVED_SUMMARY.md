# ✅ Services Stabilized - Rollouts Removed

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Action:** Removed Argo Rollouts, switched to standard Deployments  
**Status:** ✅ All Services Healthy

---

## 🎯 What We Did

### Problem:
- Services were unstable with Argo Rollouts (Blue-Green/Canary deployments)
- Multiple replica sets running simultaneously causing conflicts
- Pods constantly restarting due to probe timing issues
- ArgoCD syncing was creating confusion with rollout states

### Solution:
1. **Removed all Argo Rollouts** from the cluster
2. **Disabled rollout.yaml files** (renamed to `.disabled`)
3. **Using standard Kubernetes Deployments** only
4. **Cleaned up all old replica sets and pods**

## 📊 Current Service Status

| Service | Pods | Status | Health | Version |
|---------|------|--------|--------|---------|
| **Auth** | 1/1 | ✅ Running | UP | v1.2.6.1 |
| **Fleet** | 1/1 | ✅ Running | UP | v1.2.4.2 |
| **Booking** | 1/1 | ✅ Running | UP | v1.2.6.1 |
| **Payment** | 1/1 | ✅ Running | UP | v1.0.0 |
| **Frontend** | 2/2 | ✅ Running | UP | v1.2.5.1 |

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Files Renamed (Disabled):
```
k8s/exploresg-auth-service/rollout.yaml → rollout.yaml.disabled
k8s/exploresg-fleet-service/rollout.yaml → rollout.yaml.disabled
k8s/exploresg-frontend-service/rollout.yaml → rollout.yaml.disabled
```

### Deployments Updated:
All services now use standard `deployment.yaml` with:
- ✅ Specific version tags (no `:latest`)
- ✅ Proper probe timings (120s liveness, 100s readiness for auth)
- ✅ Single replica set per service
- ✅ Clean and predictable rolling updates

---

## 🧪 Endpoint Tests - All Passing ✅

```bash
✅ Auth Service:     Status: UP
✅ Fleet Service:    Status: UP  
✅ Booking Service:  Status: UP
✅ Payment Service:  Status: UP
✅ Frontend Service: HTTP Status: 200
```

- Fleet: https://api.xplore.town/fleet/actuator/health
- Booking: https://api.xplore.town/booking/actuator/health
- Payment: https://api.xplore.town/payment/actuator/health

## 📝 ArgoCD Status

| Application | Sync Status | Health Status |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| auth-db | Synced | Healthy |
| auth-service | OutOfSync | Healthy |
| booking-db | Synced | Healthy |
| booking-service | Synced | Healthy |
| dev-portal | Unknown | Healthy |
| fleet-db | Synced | Healthy |
| fleet-service | Synced | Healthy |
| frontend-service | Synced | Healthy |
| payment-db | Synced | Healthy |
| payment-service | Synced | Healthy |
| root | Synced | Healthy |

**Note:** Auth service shows "OutOfSync" because we disabled the rollout files locally. This is expected and not a problem.

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy Going Forward

### Current: Standard Rolling Updates
```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1
    maxUnavailable: 0
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple and predictable
- ✅ No extra complexity
- ✅ Easy to troubleshoot
- ✅ Fast deployments
- ✅ Automatic rollback on failure

### Future: Blue-Green / Canary (When Needed)
We can re-enable Argo Rollouts later when:
1. Services are fully stable
2. We need zero-downtime deployments
3. We want automated rollback based on metrics
4. We have proper monitoring configured

---

## 📋 Commands Used

### Remove Rollouts:
```bash
# Delete rollouts from cluster
kubectl delete rollout -n exploresg exploresg-auth-service
kubectl delete rollout -n exploresg exploresg-fleet-service
kubectl delete rollout -n exploresg exploresg-frontend-service

# Delete preview services
kubectl delete svc -n exploresg exploresg-auth-service-preview
```

### Apply Standard Deployments:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/exploresg-auth-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/exploresg-fleet-service/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/exploresg-frontend-service/deployment.yaml
```

### Scale Down Old Replica Sets:
```bash
kubectl scale rs -n exploresg --replicas=0 <old-replica-set-name>
```

### Clean Up Pods:
```bash
kubectl delete pods -n exploresg -l app=exploresg-<service>-service
```

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Change

| Before (Rollouts) | After (Deployments) |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| ❌ Complex state management | ✅ Simple state |
| ❌ Multiple replica sets | ✅ One replica set per service |
| ❌ Blue-Green pause states | ✅ Automatic rolling updates |
| ❌ Manual promotion needed | ✅ Automatic progression |
| ❌ Hard to debug | ✅ Easy to understand |
| ❌ Unstable during sync | ✅ Stable and predictable |

## 🔄 How to Update Services Now

### 1. Update Image Version:
```yaml
# In k8s/exploresg-[service]-service/deployment.yaml
image: sreerajrone/exploresg-[service]-service:v1.2.7
```

### 2. Apply Changes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/exploresg-[service]-service/deployment.yaml

# Or let ArgoCD auto-sync from Git
git add k8s/exploresg-[service]-service/deployment.yaml
git commit -m "Update [service] to v1.2.7"
git push origin digitalocean
```

### 3. Monitor Rollout:
```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/exploresg-[service]-service -n exploresg
```

### 4. Rollback if Needed:
```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/exploresg-[service]-service -n exploresg
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add k8s/
   git commit -m "Disable Argo Rollouts, use standard Deployments"
   git push origin digitalocean
   ```

2. **Monitor Services:**
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n exploresg -w
   ```

3. **Test All Endpoints** (already done ✅)

4. **Consider Re-enabling Rollouts** only when:
   - Services are 100% stable for 1 week
   - Proper monitoring/alerting is configured
   - Team is familiar with rollout operations

---

**Status:** ✅ All services are now stable, healthy, and using standard deployments!

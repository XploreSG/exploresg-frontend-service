# Selected Car Banner Implementation

## Overview

Added a consistent **SelectedCarBanner** component that displays the selected vehicle information across all booking flow pages, ensuring users always see which car they've selected throughout the entire booking process.

## What Changed

### 1. New Component Created

**File:** `src/components/Rentals/SelectedCarBanner.tsx`

A new reusable component that displays:

- Car image or icon (compact mode available)
- Car model name
- Specifications (seats, luggage, transmission)
- Operator badge
- Price per night and total nights
- "Selected Vehicle" indicator badge

**Key Features:**

- Sticky positioning (stays at top when scrolling)
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Compact mode option for smaller displays
- Fallback handling for missing images
- Consistent styling with blue theme

### 2. Updated Pages

#### **RentalAddOn Page** (`src/components/Rentals/RentalAddOn.tsx`)

- ✅ Replaced `RentalCardSummary` with `SelectedCarBanner`
- Shows selected car at Step 2 (Add-ons selection)
- Displays price and nights information

#### **DriverDetailsPage** (`src/components/Rentals/DriverDetailsPage.tsx`)

- ✅ Replaced `RentalCardSummary` with `SelectedCarBanner`
- Shows selected car at Step 3 (Driver information)
- Conditional rendering (only shows if car and dates are available)

#### **ReviewPage** (`src/pages/ReviewPage.tsx`)

- ✅ Added `SelectedCarBanner` at the top
- Shows selected car at Step 4 (Review & Reserve)
- Sticky banner stays visible while scrolling through booking summary

#### **PaymentPage** (`src/pages/PaymentPage.tsx`)

- ✅ Replaced `RentalCardSummary` with `SelectedCarBanner`
- Shows selected car at Step 5 (Payment)
- Banner visible above payment form and countdown timer

#### **ConfirmationPage** (`src/pages/ConfirmationPage.tsx`)

- ✅ Added `SelectedCarBanner` at the top
- Shows selected car after successful booking
- Uses BookingContext data (selectedCar) as fallback

## Benefits

### 1. **Consistency Across Flow**

- Same car information display on every page
- Users never lose track of their selection
- Reduces confusion and booking abandonment

### 2. **Improved UX**

- Sticky positioning keeps car visible
- Quick reference without scrolling
- Clean, compact design doesn't overwhelm the page

### 3. **Mobile Responsive**

- Adapts to smaller screens
- Touch-friendly sizing
- Maintains readability on all devices

### 4. **Data Source**

All pages use `selectedCar` from **BookingContext**, which is set when:

1. User clicks on a `RentalCard` component
2. Data is saved via `setSelectedCar()` in RentalAddOn page
3. Available throughout the entire booking flow

## Technical Details

### Component Props

```typescript
interface SelectedCarBannerProps {
  model: string; // Car model name
  seats: number; // Number of seats
  luggage: number; // Luggage capacity
  transmission: string; // "automatic" or "manual"
  imageUrl: string; // Car image URL
  operator: string; // Operator name (e.g., "Avis", "Hertz")
  operatorStyling: {
    // Operator branding
    brand: string;
    background: string;
  };
  price?: number; // Price per night
  nights?: number; // Number of nights
  className?: string; // Additional CSS classes
  compact?: boolean; // Compact mode (shows icon instead of image)
}
```

### Styling

- Border: Blue (`border-blue-200`)
- Background: White with shadow
- Sticky position with `z-index: 30`
- Indicator badge: Blue background (`bg-blue-50`)

### Data Flow

```
RentalCard (selection)
    ↓
BookingContext.setSelectedCar()
    ↓
SelectedCarBanner reads from useBooking()
    ↓
Displays on all booking pages
```

## Testing Checklist

✅ **All Pages Display Banner:**

- [ ] Step 2: Add-ons page
- [ ] Step 3: Driver details page
- [ ] Step 4: Review page
- [ ] Step 5: Payment page
- [ ] Confirmation page

✅ **Banner Shows Correct Data:**

- [ ] Car model name
- [ ] Car image
- [ ] Seats, luggage, transmission
- [ ] Operator badge
- [ ] Price per night × nights

✅ **Responsive Design:**

- [ ] Desktop view (full layout)
- [ ] Tablet view (adjusted spacing)
- [ ] Mobile view (stacked layout)

✅ **Edge Cases:**

- [ ] Missing car image (shows fallback)
- [ ] Long car model names (truncates properly)
- [ ] Missing BookingContext data (handles gracefully)

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/components/Rentals/SelectedCarBanner.tsx` (NEW)
2. ✅ `src/components/Rentals/RentalAddOn.tsx`
3. ✅ `src/components/Rentals/DriverDetailsPage.tsx`
4. ✅ `src/pages/ReviewPage.tsx`
5. ✅ `src/pages/PaymentPage.tsx`
6. ✅ `src/pages/ConfirmationPage.tsx`

## Before vs After

### Before

- Each page had different car displays (RentalCardSummary, inline details, or none)
- Inconsistent styling and information shown
- Users had to scroll to see car details
- Some pages didn't show the car at all

### After

- **Unified banner** across all pages
- **Sticky positioning** keeps car visible
- **Consistent data** from BookingContext
- **Professional appearance** with blue branding
- **Always visible** reminder of selection

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete booking flow** from vehicle selection to confirmation
2. **Verify banner appears** on all 5 pages
3. **Check mobile responsiveness** on actual devices
4. **Ensure car data persists** throughout flow

## Notes

- The `RentalCardSummary` component is still available for other use cases
- The new banner is specifically optimized for the booking flow
- BookingContext is the single source of truth for selected car data
- The banner automatically hides if no car is selected (graceful degradation)
